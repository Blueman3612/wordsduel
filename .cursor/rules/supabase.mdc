description: Always use the SQL Editor
globs:

When interacting with Supabase, remember to:

- NEVER attempt to use CLI
- NEVER create a .sql migration file
- ALWAYS just give code that can be copy pasted into the SQL Editor in browser
- ALWAYS give me the SQL Editor code in its ENTIRETY, don't give me partial code to suggest an edit
